# EC-Machine
directions 
System.out.print(ecCalculator(ecMachine, input);

if there is no need for an input you can delete it from the ecCalculator's parameters or it may work on its own.


1.1 3101878
don't have original sequence to see if it still workds but this is what I got
1.2 it was like 84 and something for the noun and verb

2.1 = 11933517
2.2 = 10428568
  this was the answer I was getting but all the sudden after I fixed a few errors for 2.1 i was getting an index error of 678 out of bounds for length 678. I plan to go back in the coming days and find where I am off by ONE INDEX :(
3.1 work in progress

thank you to Justin and Jarett for helping me with ideas for implementation and telling me what is ineffecient. thank you to Rhazes and my class mates (Justin, Jarett, Ben, and Alex) for helping me grock with these concepts and discussing approaches. Thanks Jarett for the getData method (made what I did WAAYYY simpler)
